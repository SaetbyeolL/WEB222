                These days, everyone’s a sourdough baker, fire pits are sold out everywhere and telescope sales have skyrocketed. That’s right, telescopes are suddenly hard to find amid the coronavirus pandemic as Canadians opt to explore closer to home, spurring a renewed interest in those twinkly lights in the sky, rather than board flights for far-flung destinations.

                Calgary-based Alan Dyer, astronomy photographer and creator of the website amazingsky.com, says fall is prime astronomy season. “You don’t have to go around the world to do stargazing,” he says. Lucky for us, Canada’s latitude provides plenty of stargazing opportunities – and you don’t need even a telescope to take advantage; you can be a novice and still enjoy the night sky with simple binoculars and trusty phone apps. Dyer recommends SkySafari, which has a free version as well as more advanced paid versions. Other apps to get up to snuff on the stars include Night Sky, Sky Chart and even the NASA app if you’re looking for additional space education.
